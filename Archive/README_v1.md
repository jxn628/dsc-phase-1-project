For low budget, I recommended that they explore other genres with a high chance of breaking even and good potentional for perfoming in the top quartile.

    "- **Horror, Thriller, and Romance** films all have a better than 50% chance of breaking even, rank high in ROI potentional, and about a third of them could end up being one of the Top 500 profitable movies. \n",
